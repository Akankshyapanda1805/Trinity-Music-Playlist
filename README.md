# Trinity-Music-Playlist
## ABSTRACT 
The Music Playlist System is a dynamic and user-friendly application designed for our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. This system offers a seamless and personalized music listening experience, featuring efficient data structures and algorithms to manage and optimize playlist creation and song recommendations. Users can create, edit, and manage playlists with ease, utilizing data structures like linked lists and arrays for efficient storage and retrieval of songs. To enhance user engagement, the system employs algorithms for intelligent song recommendations, considering user preferences, genre, and song popularity, resulting in a customized and enjoyable music journey. Moreover, advanced sorting algorithms facilitate playlist organization and search operations, ensuring quick access to desired tracks. The Music Playlist System also focuses on minimizing time complexities and memory usage, providing a fast and responsive user interface. In this DSA project, we showcase the implementation of key data structures and algorithms to deliver a robust and efficient music playlist system that caters to the ever-evolving tastes of music enthusiasts.

## OBJECTIVE 
The objective of our music playlist system DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) project is to design and implement an efficient and user-friendly platform that allows users to create, manage, and enjoy personalized music playlists. This project aims to employ various data structures and algorithms to optimize playlist creation, search, and recommendation functions, providing a seamless and responsive user experience. By prioritizing algorithmic efficiency and robust data structures, we intend to deliver a feature-rich music playlist system that enhances music discovery and organization for users while serving as a practical and educational demonstration of DSA principles.

## REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

From the given scenario, we draw the following requirements:

### User Interface and Interaction:
Users should be able to create new playlists with unique names. • Users should be able to add songs to a playlist and remove them. • Users should be able to rename playlists, reorder songs, and delete playlists.

### Data Structures and Algorithms:
Choose an appropriate data structure (e.g., linked list, array, etc.) to represent a playlist. • Decide how to store information about each song. Consider using a data structure like a struct or class to encapsulate this information.

### Error Handling and Validation:
Ensure that user inputs are properly validated to prevent invalid operations (e.g., attempting to remove a song that doesn't exist). • Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users when they make mistakes or encounter issues.

### Performance and Scalability:
Ensure that the system performs efficiently for typical operations even with large playlists. • Use appropriate algorithms to perform operations on playlists and songs efficiently.

## Hardware Requirement

Processor: Dual-core or higher processor.

RAM: 2 GB of RAM or more.

Storage: At least 8 GB of internal storage.

Display: A screen with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels or higher.

Battery: A battery with sufficient capacity to run the device for a reasonable amount of time, typically around 2000 mAh or more.

Operating System: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher.

## CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the music playlist system developed for this DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) project in C++ provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing and enjoying music. The system incorporates essential data structures such as linked lists and dynamic arrays to handle the storage and organization of songs and playlists.

Key features of the system include the ability to create, edit, and delete playlists, as well as adding and removing songs from playlists. Additionally, the system allows for seamless navigation through the library, enabling users to search for songs by title, artist, or genre.

The implementation of algorithms like sorting and searching ensures that the system operates efficiently, even with a large dataset. The system's user interface is intuitive, providing clear instructions and feedback to the user.

While the current version of the system meets the basic requirements, there is room for further enhancement. Future iterations could incorporate features such as a graphical user interface (GUI), support for additional audio formats, and integration with external music libraries or streaming services.

Overall, this music playlist system serves as a solid foundation for further development and expansion, demonstrating the successful application of data structures and algorithms in creating a practical and functional software solution.
